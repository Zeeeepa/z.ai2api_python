"""
Grok Provider Tests - PLACEHOLDER

NOTE: The Grok provider (groq_provider.py) exists as a standalone client
but is not currently integrated with the BaseProvider pattern used by
other providers (Z.AI, K2Think, Qwen).

To enable Grok provider testing, the groq_provider.py needs to be refactored to:
1. Inherit from BaseProvider
2. Implement get_supported_models()
3. Implement chat_completions() async method
4. Follow the provider registration pattern

Current Status:
- ❌ Grok provider NOT integrated with provider system
- ✅ Z.AI provider fully integrated and tested
- ✅ K2Think provider fully integrated and tested
- ✅ Qwen provider fully integrated and tested

To integrate Grok:
1. Refactor GrokApiClient to inherit from BaseProvider
2. Add Grok provider registration in provider_factory.py
3. Implement comprehensive tests here
