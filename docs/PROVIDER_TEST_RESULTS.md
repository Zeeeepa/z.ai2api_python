# Provider Test Results

Date: 2025-10-06  
Test Script: `tests/test_providers_real.py`

## Summary

Comprehensive testing of Z.AI, K2Think, and Qwen providers revealed that all three require browser-based authentication rather than simple API endpoints.

## Test Configuration

### Credentials Used
```
Z.AI:
- Email: developer@pixelium.uk
- Password: developer123?
- Base URL: https://chat.z.ai

K2Think:
- Email: developer@pixelium.uk
- Password: developer123?
- Base URL: https://www.k2think.ai

Qwen:
- Email: developer@pixelium.uk
- Password: developer1?
- Base URL: https://chat.qwen.ai
```

## Detailed Results

### Z.AI
| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Guest Token | ✅ SUCCESS | Successfully retrieved guest token from `/api/v1/auths/` |
| Login | ❌ FAILED | 405 Not Allowed - Login endpoint doesn't accept simple POST |
| Models List | ❌ FAILED | 403 Forbidden - Guest token insufficient for `/api/models` |
| Completion (Non-streaming) | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No models available |
| Completion (Streaming) | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No models available |

**Notes:**
- Guest tokens work but have very limited permissions
- Models endpoint requires additional authentication
- Login likely requires browser session or OAuth flow

### K2Think
| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Guest Token | ❌ FAILED | 403 Forbidden - No guest token available |
| Login | ❌ FAILED | 405 Not Allowed - Login endpoint doesn't accept simple POST |
| Models List | ❌ FAILED | 403 Forbidden - No authentication method works |
| Completion (Non-streaming) | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No models available |
| Completion (Streaming) | ⏭️ SKIPPED | No models available |

**Notes:**
- No guest token support
- All endpoints require proper authentication
- Likely needs browser-based login with session capture

### Qwen
| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Guest Token | ❌ FAILED | 401 Unauthorized - No guest token support |
| Login | ❌ FAILED | 405 Not Allowed - Login endpoint doesn't accept simple POST |
| Models List | ✅ SUCCESS | **Found 4 models publicly accessible** |
| Completion (Non-streaming) | ❌ FAILED | 504 Gateway Timeout |
| Completion (Streaming) | ❌ FAILED | 504 Gateway Timeout |

**Available Models:**
1. `qwen3-max` - Qwen3-Max
2. `qwen3-vl-plus` - Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B
3. `qwen3-coder-plus` - Qwen3-Coder
4. `qwen3-vl-30b-a3b` - Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B

**Notes:**
- `/api/models` endpoint is publicly accessible (no auth required)
- Completion endpoints time out, possibly requiring proper authentication
- Shows promise for future implementation

## Conclusions

### Authentication Requirements

All three providers require more sophisticated authentication than simple API calls:

1. **Browser-Based Authentication**: Login endpoints return 405 (Method Not Allowed), suggesting they expect browser-based authentication flows

2. **Session Management**: Likely need to capture and maintain browser session cookies

3. **OAuth/SAML**: Providers may use OAuth or SAML flows that require browser interaction

### Recommended Solutions

#### Option 1: Playwright Browser Automation
Similar to the grok2api implementation:
- Launch headless browser
- Navigate to login page
- Fill credentials and submit
- Capture session cookies/tokens
- Use captured credentials for API calls

**Pros:**
- Most reliable and comprehensive
- Works with complex auth flows
- Can handle 2FA if needed

**Cons:**
- Resource intensive
- Requires maintaining browser instance
- More complex to implement

#### Option 2: Manual Token Capture
Ask users to provide their session tokens:
- User logs in via browser
- Extracts session token from browser DevTools
- Provides token to application

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement
- No browser automation needed
- Immediate testing possible

**Cons:**
- Manual user intervention required
- Tokens expire, need refresh
- Security concerns sharing tokens

#### Option 3: Focus on Working APIs
Prioritize Qwen since its models endpoint works:
- Use publicly available model information
- Investigate proper completion endpoint auth
- Build from what works

**Pros:**
- Fastest path to working implementation
- Can demonstrate value quickly
- Learn auth patterns from one provider

**Cons:**
- Limited to one provider initially
- Still need to solve auth eventually

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Decide on authentication approach
2. **Short-term**: Implement chosen auth method for at least one provider
3. **Medium-term**: Extend to all three providers
4. **Long-term**: Add token refresh and session management

## Test Execution

To run these tests manually:

```bash
# Run all provider tests
python tests/test_providers_real.py

# Run with pytest
pytest tests/test_providers_real.py -v

# Run specific provider
pytest tests/test_providers_real.py -k "zai" -v
```
